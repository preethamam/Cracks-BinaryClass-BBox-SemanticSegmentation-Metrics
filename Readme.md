# Introduction


Cracks are the defects formed by cyclic loading, fatigue, shrinkage, creep, and so on. In addition, they represent the deterioration of the structures over some time. Therefore, it is essential to detect and classify them according to the condition grade at the early stages to prevent the collapse of structures. Cracks can be segmented using the classical semantic segmentation methods such as morphological, Hessian and Multiscale Fractional Anisotropic Tensor that are widely used in medical imaging community. In this repository, the object detection and semantic segmentation metrics for the binary class of the cracks and non-cracks are developed from the scratch and presented.
